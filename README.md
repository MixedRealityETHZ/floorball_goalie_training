# floorball_goalie_training

This mixed reality application's main goal is to provide additional visual cues for floorball goalkeepers in order to help them train and develop an intuitive understanding of how the ball could hit the goal. Important features of the app include automatic goal alignment via ArUco markers as well as ball tracking and the display of a projection plane conveying the information of the area the goalkeeper has to cover in order to protect the goal in the most intuitive way.

This README serves mostly as a quick explanation and collection of all material.

## GitHub repository and other project files
[This repository](https://github.com/MixedRealityETHZ/floorball_goalie_training) contains our main scripts (in the folder scripts). 

For the entire project, refer to [Polybox](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/YaRIYX1tQxN0eHT) instead, where you can download all the Unity files. It is important to note that our project makes use of the library *OpenCV for Unity*, which can be found in the Asset Store. 
We avoided uploading the entire project to GitHub, as it took up too much space in the past, which is why we provide polybox as an alternative for the files beyond scripts.

## Report
For further technical details, refer to the [report](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/FrUx4Z2axJx4Jtf).

## Demo
The demo presentation slides can also be found on [Polybox](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/2eE2kAFLVHstTKe). We have also done a [more detailed demo video](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/vR9JBhu69ky2Mbe), also including some improvements that have been made since the demo session (most notably increasing the framerate from about 6 to 15). 

## Submission
Both the report and more detailed demo video will be submitted via moodle.
